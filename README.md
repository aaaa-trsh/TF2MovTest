# TF2MovTest
TF2-like movement in UE4

This is for you, @Sekyom#1246.

Also - (in it's current state) - this project is really messy in terms of code and organization. Will be cleaning it up more later.


TODO:
 - Make crouch walk work, and schedule it after sliding friction.
 - Tune values, add velocity cap.
 - Climbing is not super great
 - Animation placeholders
